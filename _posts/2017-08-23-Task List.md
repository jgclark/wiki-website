## Basic Usage

Use the following markdown to show a **Task List**:

```gfm
- [ ] This task is incomplete.
- [x] This task is completed.
```

## Change Task Status

As well as editing the task text to change it from `[ ]` to `[x]` to mark a task complete, you can click on the checkbox of current task list, or use menu item `Paragraph` → `Task Status`. (Please see [Custom Key Binding](/Custom-Key-Binding/) if you'd like to assign a shortcut key.)

## "Strike out" Completed Tasks

If you would like Typora to automatically  strike through completed tasks:

![Snip20170824_1](/media/task-list/Snip20170824_1.png) 

then add following Custom CSS to your theme:

```css
.task-list-done {
    /* styles for completed tasks */
    text-decoration: line-through;
}
.task-list-not-done {
    /* styles for incomplete tasks */
}
```

You can also add CSS to make completed tasks in the list look less obvious. You could add something like `color: #777` to change the text color for selector `.task-list-done`.

> Tip: For more details on adding or changing CSS please see [Add Custom CSS](/Add-Custom-CSS/).
