> TIP: To learn more about where to put CSS snippets, please see [Add Custom CSS](/Add-Custom-CSS/).

To get text to flow from right-to-left, add the following Custom CSS:

```css
#write {
    direction: rtl;
}
```
> This is not fully tested, since I'm not a RTL user, if you found any bugs, please report to <hi@typora.io>
